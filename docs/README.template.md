## Concepts

A **room** (`gatho/room`) is a shared multiplayer session — a game match, a lobby, a collaborative space. Organise your application and state however you like, use `start` to initialize the room.

A **server** (`gatho/server`) hosts rooms. You run one or more — each registers itself with the driver so the SDK knows it exists and can place rooms on it. You tell the server how to run rooms — by default `subprocess()` spawns each room as its own process, but you can run rooms in the same process, in a container, whatever you want. Rooms report their health and status back to the server over a Unix domain socket. Running multiple servers gives you horizontal scale.

Your backend uses the **SDK** (`gatho/sdk`) to manage rooms — create, query, and destroy them, tag them for filtering, and call `join()` to mint a short-lived token URL you hand to your client. Tags and client data make it flexible enough to build whatever matchmaking logic you need.

The **driver** (`gatho/driver`) is the shared state store — Redis, Postgres, or in-memory — that lets multiple server instances coordinate.

## Quick Start

First, write a simple room that counts connections and messages:

<Snippet source="./src/quick-start-room.ts" />

Start a gatho server with a driver and tell it how to run your rooms:

<Snippet source="./src/quick-start-server.ts" />

Then you can start rooms using the `gatho/sdk`:

<Snippet source="./src/quick-start-sdk.ts" />

And you can connect to URLs returned by `join()` with `gatho/client`:

<Snippet source="./src/quick-start-client.ts" />

## Client

`gatho/client` is a thin WebSocket wrapper that handles the things you'd otherwise build yourself:

- **Automatic reconnection** — on unexpected disconnect the client enters a `reconnecting` state and retries with exponential backoff and jitter.
- **Reliable messaging** — messages sent while reconnecting are buffered (up to 1MB by default) and flushed in order once the connection is restored. Mark a message as `{ reliable: false }` to drop it instead. Future features around backpressure and handling and WebTransport will build on this.
- **Session continuity** — the server issues a session token on first connect. On reconnect the client presents it automatically, so the server sees the same `clientId` and can resume where it left off.
- **Clean close** — `close()` sends a protocol-level leave message so the server knows the disconnect was intentional and skips the reconnection window.

On the server side, opt in to reconnection by calling `room.allowReconnection(client, windowMs)` inside `onDrop`. Reliable messages sent to a disconnected client are buffered (up to `maxBufferBytes`, default 1MB) and flushed automatically on reconnect. If the buffer overflows or the window expires, the client is evicted and `onLeave` fires.

<Snippet source="./src/reconnection.ts" />

## Messages

gatho is unopinionated about message format — `room.send()` and `room.broadcast()` accept `string | ArrayBuffer | ArrayBufferView`, and `onMessage` receives `string | ArrayBuffer`. For JSON, call `JSON.stringify()` / `JSON.parse()` yourself — gatho stays out of the way.

If you want good performance without sacrificing developer experience, [packcat](https://github.com/isaac-mason/packcat) plays well with gatho. Define schemas once, share them between client and server, and get compact binary encoding with full TypeScript types — no code generation, no IDL files.

<Snippet source="./src/binary-messages.ts" />

## Room Lifecycle

<Snippet source="./src/room-lifecycle.ts" />

## Drivers

Drivers provide the shared state backend used by the server and SDK.

- `createMemoryDriver()` — useful for local dev, tests, and onebox deployments
- `createRedisDriver({ url })` — requires Redis
- `createPostgresDriver({ connectionString })` — requires Postgres (Experimental!)
